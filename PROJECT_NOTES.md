# StatChat — project notes

Architectural decisions and the reasoning behind them. `TODO.md` tracks
what's left to do; this tracks *why things are the way they are*, so
that reasoning survives even if a chat is lost. Check this alongside
`TODO.md` at the start of any session touching the game engine, stat
computation, or reporting.

## Sack yardage methodology (verified August 3-4, 2026)

**Team-level totals subtract sack yardage from Pass Yards, not
Rushing.** This was verified directly against a real, independently
documented NFL game (Bills 34, Cardinals 28, Sept. 8 2024) via
nflverse play-by-play data cross-checked with ESPN/Fox Sports box
scores. The gap between a QB's personal passing statline and the
team's official Pass Yards total was exactly that game's sack yardage
lost, in both directions (Buffalo and Arizona).

**The asymmetry that matters:** an individual passer's own row in the
Passing table (`stat_package.html`, `recap.html`, season player
tables) stays unadjusted — it matches the player's personal statline
convention, same as a real box score's "18-23, 232 yds" line for a QB.
Only the *team-level* total (Total Yards, Pass Yards tiles, chart
totals, XLS Game Totals sheet) subtracts sack yardage. Don't "fix" the
individual player rows to match the team total — they're correct as
they are.

**Known, deliberate inconsistency:** the XLS export's "Stats" sheet
still has a separate "Sacks and Bad Snaps" row tracking sack yardage
as a negative *rushing* line. This matches the user's original
reference spreadsheet's own convention, not the verified NFL
methodology — it predates the verification and was intentionally left
as-is to match that reference file's row structure. It is not summed
into the "Game Totals" sheet's Total Yards column (which correctly
uses the verified, sack-adjusted number instead). If asked to reconcile
these, that's the tension to explain — don't assume it's a bug.

## The sack engine bug (found August 3-4, 2026)

`game.html`'s sack panel is labeled "Yards lost," and a coach
naturally types the positive magnitude of that loss. Nothing in the
pipeline negated it before feeding the engine's actual field-position
and down-tracking logic — so entering a real 7-yard sack moved the
ball *forward* 7 yards and computed "2nd & 3" instead of "2nd & 17."

This went undetected by the extensive earlier NFL fuzz-testing because
that testing called `parseInput()` directly with pre-built play
strings, bypassing the actual HTML input fields entirely — the exact
step where the bug lived. This is the reasoning behind the "re-run the
NFL games through the actual UI" item in `TODO.md`: any test that
skips real DOM input can miss this entire class of bug.

Fixed in `parseInput()`'s sack branch: the parsed "yards lost" value is
kept positive for the display text ("sacked for 7 yds"), but negated
before being used as `netYards` for game-state purposes. Verified
directly: sack now moves the ball backward and calculates down/distance
correctly; a normal rush play was regression-tested and still works.

## Why the engine is duplicated across pages, not shared yet

`view.html`, `recap.html`, `stat_package.html`, and `season_report.html`
each carry their own copy of `computeState`, `computeBoxScore`,
`buildTeams`, etc., copied verbatim from `game.html`. This was a
deliberate choice earlier in the project — "port the proven engine
verbatim, don't rewrite it" — to avoid introducing subtle differences
between pages. The trade-off is real: a fix has to be manually,
correctly repeated in every copy, which is how both the sack-yardage
inconsistency and an earlier `RECEIVE_POS` omission bug happened.
Consolidating into one shared JS file is on `TODO.md`, not done yet.

## Season report chart/metric layout

Metrics that summarize what a chart shows are placed directly above
that chart, not in one long flat list at the top of a section
(`stat_package.html`'s team-stats tiles and `season_report.html`'s
season-level tiles both follow this). Where a section has multiple
charts side by side, the HTML emits all the metric-groups as flat
sibling grid items first, then all the charts as flat sibling grid
items after — *not* nested per-column — so CSS Grid's row
auto-placement naturally equalizes each row's height across columns.
Nesting metrics+chart together per column was tried first and broke
alignment whenever one column's metrics wrapped to more rows than
its neighbor's.

Chart colors are derived from the team's actual branded primary/
secondary colors (account settings), not a fixed palette. Text sitting
inside a colored fill (donut slices, stacked-bar segments) picks black
or white dynamically based on that specific fill color's luminance —
never assume brand colors are dark enough for white text by default;
Neville's own brand color is a light gold, which is exactly the case
that assumption gets wrong.

## GameID

There's no dedicated GameID column in the database — it's parsed out
of `game.designator` via regex (`/(\d+)/`) wherever the XLS exports
need a numeric GameID. If a game's designator doesn't contain a
number, GameID falls back to the designator string itself.
